# Paligemma from Scratch

This repository contains notes and an implementation of the Paligemma paper from scratch. Paligemma is Google's cutting edge open vision language model. I would like to give credit to Umar Jamil, most of the notes and implementations are based on his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAmKB7iPkWw&t=478s).
